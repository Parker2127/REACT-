# What Have We Learned Today? 🚀

We've made significant progress today, completing two insightful modules on JavaScript. Let's dive into the details. 📚

## Module-1: A Brief Introduction to JavaScript 🌟

### Terms in JavaScript
- **JavaScript**: The core scripting language, known as Vanilla JS. 🍦
- **ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturer Association)**:
  - A specification for ensuring JavaScript compatibility across browsers. 🌍
  - Versions include ES6, ES2015, ES2017, ES2020, etc. 📅
  - Babel.js helps convert these versions to be compatible with current browsers. 🔧
- **TypeScript**: A JavaScript dialect with a `.ts` extension. 📘
- **JSX**: A JavaScript extension for React. ⚛️

### Frameworks
- Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular enable front-end JavaScript development. 🖼️
- These frameworks provide an abstraction layer over JavaScript. 🛠️

### Build Tools
- Tools like npm, webpack, and Gulp automate the optimization of JavaScript for browsers. 🚀

### Conclusion
- Understanding Vanilla JS is foundational for learning additional concepts and frameworks. 🎓

### Getting Started Tools
1. Modern Browser (Chrome) 🌐
2. Code Editor (VS Code) 💻
3. Live Server Environment (Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey in VS Code) 📡
4. Browser console (Inspect -> Console) for direct JavaScript interaction. 🔍

### Formatting and Linting
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** enhance code quality and formatting, requiring Node.js for installation. ✨

### Using the Browser Console
- The console allows for direct code interaction and testing. 🧪

### Types of Comments
- `//` for single-line comments. 💬
- `/* */` for multiline comments. 📝
- `/**` above a function automatically prompts for parameter documentation. 📖

### Customizing Indentation
- Adjust Tab spaces in VS Code for personalized indentation preferences. 📐

### Interesting Points
- Semicolons (`;`) and quotation marks (`'` or `"`) are based on personal preference. 🤷‍♂️

### LifeSaver
- **MDN Web Docs**: An invaluable resource for deepening understanding after each topic. 🏆

## Module-2: Up and Running with JS 🏃‍♂️

### Including JavaScript in HTML
1. **Inline**: Direct inclusion within the HTML document using the `<script>` tag. ✏️
2. **External File**: Similar to external CSS, promoting cleaner code structure. 📁

### Async and Defer
- **Async** downloads JavaScript in parallel with HTML parsing, executing it once downloaded. ⏩
- **Defer** downloads JavaScript in parallel but waits until the HTML parsing is complete before execution. 🕒

### Modules in JavaScript
- Modules support code modularization, allowing separation of functions, components, and data objects into individual files. 🧩
- Using `type="module"` in a script tag defers it automatically, avoiding render-blocking issues. 🚫🛑

Looking forward to learning all about objects in the coming module! 🤓
